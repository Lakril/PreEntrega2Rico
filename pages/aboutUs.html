                <p>We knew that the process of acquiring, analyzing, and managing complex data, then surgically teasing out insights was demanding job, even for most technology-capable companies, let alone governments.</p><br>
                <p>The problem space required a special kind of talent and technology mix to deliver meaningful solutions to customers. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>That is why we enlisted an elite unit of seasoned data experts, computer researchers, and software engineers to develop an array of advanced suite of data-driven products. These allow us to offer unrivaled, pin-point accurate information. </p>

                <h2>MISSION</h2>
                <p>Its starts with a clearly-defined problem and mission to solve it. Look around the country, across many cities — there is a shortfall of local revenue, while residential upgrades outpace proper local regulation.</p><br>
                <p>Deckard’s mission is to ensure that local governments have the answers and insights to create and reform spaces that lift the quality of life for all of its citizens. We aim to return equity of obligations back to the community, and sustain healthy revenue to support smart city growth.</p><br>

                <h2>TALENT</h2>
                <p>Deckard was forged from existing relationships of experts in the data field. The original team is comprised of eight former Qualcomm engineers involved in research, data engineering, autonomous vehicles, sensors, IOT and software security. We continue to fortify our ranks with new technical talent.</p><br>
                <p>Deckard boasts an exceptional technical team, led by co-founder Greg Rose. Rose has spent 18 years at Qualcomm as a Senior VP of product security, data mining, and open source, and owns over 100 registered patents.</p><br>

              <h2>FOCUS</h2>
              <P>We focus on building and tuning a robust and intelligent data platform that ingests multiple private and public data streams. We create a highly refined, high value dataset for our suite of data-driven products.</P><br>
              <p>Our team is constantly enhancing our capabilities to facilitate answers for municipalities. We achieve this by clearly and correctly identifying properties that have undergone a physical change or exhibited unreported activities. And this is just the start. Our data platform has evolved to go beyond assessments and a property’s permit history to capture a wide range of rental activities.</p>
